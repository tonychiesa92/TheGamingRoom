Software design document for Draw It or Lose It.

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game based on their current Android app, Draw It or Lose It. The client is looking to establish the environment and streamline the development process.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The organization of this document breaks down who the client is and what they want in a clear manor. Then based on those needs makes appropriate recommendations.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

After putting together the design document I found that developing the code for this project was easier because it allowed for me to work within the scope of the project with clear expectations of what was needed.  

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

To add to and improve this document it would be beneficial to the client for a true cost/benefit analysis of each operating platform.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs are important to consider for a game, such as Draw It of Lose It, because the users are the ones playing the game. It is important that the game run smoothly and looks good to the user.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

In designing this software, I gathered the client’s needs and I recommended the operating platform and hardware requirements. Then I developed a prototype. Next, I made appropriate adjustments to the hardware, operating system, and code. In the future I would utilize a framework to manage the full lifecycle of the development process, such as Agile.
